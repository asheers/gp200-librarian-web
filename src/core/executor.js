// Phase 3 S3.1 (second slice): the plan executor. Runs a plan from plan.js

//
//   confirm   confirmPlan(): every plan needs an explicit confirmation, a Swap
//             included; the tick box only where the preview has one (a real
//             patch is lost). Only tokens made by confirmPlan for THIS plan
//             object are accepted.
//   gate      the before-image file (planJournalZip) was saved and confirmed
//             on disk (beforeImageVerified), and it holds exactly this plan's
//             before-images. Fails closed.
//   journal   ONE operation record with every before-image, every step's
//             content and expected bytes, and each step's state. Committed
//             before anything is sent; updated before and after every step.
//             A failed save aborts; a failed update stops before the next
//             write.
//   re-check  every input is read again; abort if any differs (PATCH CONTENT)
//             from what the user confirmed against.
//   steps     in plan order: re-read the slot immediately before writing; it
//             must still hold what the plan expects (its original); write with
//             the CLI pacing (device.writeImage, under the guard's permit for
//             exactly the plan's slots, ended in `finally`);
//             read back and verify against `expected` with copy.js's
//             readBackAndVerify (PATCH CONTENT; on a mismatch 2 confirmation
//             reads, never a second write).
//   stop      at the first step that is not verified, at an unexpected state,
//             at a failed read, or after a preset change the app did not send
//             (a footswitch). Never retried, never rolled back on its own.
//   end       when every step verified: re-read every input. Written slots
//             must still verify; the others must be unchanged.
//
// Step states: pending -> in-flight -> verified | failed | unknown | refused;
// steps after a stop stay not-started. The record keeps the before-images
// and the read-backs, which is what recovery ("Check and recover") and
// multi-level Undo need later.
//
// The guard still refuses an upload or preset change outside the plan's
// permit, whatever zone the plan was built with.
