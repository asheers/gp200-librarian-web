// Talking to the pedal over a MIDI input/output pair.
//
// Transport-agnostic: `input` needs an `onmidimessage` property and `output`
// a `send(Uint8Array)` method -- real Web MIDI ports in the browser, or the
// fake pedal in tests and demo mode. The output is ALWAYS wrapped in the
// Phase 2 write guard here (write-guard.js), whatever it is given: reads of
// any slot, but uploads and preset changes only to the scratch bank 60.
//
// Active slot (Phase 3 S0): recorded, never inferred. It is "unknown" at
// connect (the identity reply carries no slot). It becomes known when this
// app sends a preset change, and when the pedal sends its unsolicited preset
// change echo. On the user's GP-200 (W1 log, 2026-10-07) that echo is byte
// for byte the same 30-byte frame as our own preset change, for our changes
// and for a footswitch press alike, so presetChangeSlot() recognises it
// exactly. Anything else (the after-upload 12 08 notice, the 46-byte 12 10
// state message) is not a slot change. Tracking sends nothing.
//
// Connect sends only the identity query. "Enter editor mode" is sent only
// when the first write of a connection is about to happen (reads work
// without it; uploads are silently discarded without it).
//
// writeImage() is one upload with the CLI's conservative pacing (donpark's
// gp200.py write_slot @ c3fe41f): park on the neighbouring slot, upload with
// 40 ms between chunks, settle 1 s, preset change to the written slot, 300 ms.
// It does not verify: the caller (copy.js) reads back and compares.
